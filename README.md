# Ethereum Analysis
This repository hosts the code for analyzing Ethereum, a blockchain-based distributed computing platform.

## Project Overview
Ethereum offers a decentralized platform where users can exchange currency (Ether), leverage or purchase services (smart contracts), mint their own tokens, among other applications. The Ethereum network employs public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process and validate transactions.
